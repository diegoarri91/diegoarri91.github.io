description: "How do neurons encode and decode stimuli? In one of my PhD projects, I studied this question using machine 
learning applied to time series neural data. By fitting generalized linear models to the data, we can predict and 
understand how neurons map input stimuli to responses. Then by using synthetic responses I used a Bayesian framework to 
decode stimuli to explore how neurons transmit information. I developed a Python library to fit the models and performed
 the decoding, including the optimization problem. In this project, I also used methods like linear discriminant 
analysis, information theory and methods for time series analysis."
